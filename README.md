# EarlyDiagCRC
Identification of CRC and normal samples based on methylation probe expression profile.
# Install
To install the EarlyDiagCRC, install from github using devtools
```
library(devtools)
install_github("Zhao-Wenyuan/EarlyDiagCRC")
```
Or you can download the .ZIP file and and unzip it.
```
install.packages("EarlyDiagCRC",repos = NULL,type="source")
#The "EarlyDiagCRC" should be combined with the absolute path.
```
# Usage
```
library(EarlyDiagCRC)
data(example)
data(model)
Pred=EarlyDiag(data1)#This function is used to predict the input of unknown samples.
Eval=EarlyDiag_AUC(Tumor,Normal,ROC=TRUE)#This function is used to test the known labels of the input of samples.
biomakers()#The methylation probe markers used in the model and the corresponding gene information were displayed. 
```
The example is two DNA methylation probes("cg07146119","cg06848185") data values (Î² value) of CRC sample from TCGA M450K data.
# Data input
Tumor or Normal, a dataframe with methylation probes beta values where columns are samples and rows are probes IDs.
